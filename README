BATTLE GALAKTIA

Battle Galaktia is a classic 2D space shooter game. Guide your spaceship through the infinite space battling with alien ships firing with single canon or double canon or both.


Development:

The project was made with an objective to learn and demonstrate 2D animations and transformations in OpenGL. It is written in C++ language. IDE used for developing the project was Visual Studio 2012.


Installation:

On windows, download 'Battle Galaktia(for windows).zip', extract and open .exe file. Freeglut.dll is provided in the zip file.

On Linux,
1. Install OpenGL using the following command: sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev mesa-utils
2. Open the main.cpp file and compile it with: gcc main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lstdc++


Project Highlights:

1. All basic OpenGL functions used.
2. Double Buffering to provide smooth flicker free 2D animation. (FPS=60)
3. Two collision detection algorithms used in moveutility.h to detect collision between alienship and bullets, and spaceship and alienship.
4. Store and read highscore from file.
5. Game can be paused and resumed.
6. Keyboard controls for both left and right handers.
7. Four-directional movement of spaceship and single and double firing canons.
8. Random generation of position of alienships.

Enter key: start game
Up key / 'w': move ship up
Left key / 'a': move ship left
Down key / 's': move ship down
Right key / 'd': move ship right
Spacebar: single fire
'B'/'b': double fire
